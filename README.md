# Deterministic Roulette Demo

### README is a work in progress...

### Controls and Gameplay Instructions:
- Select chips from the menu on the lower side. There are 5 different chip types. The default one is red, which is valued at 100.
- Interact with the board in the center to place your bets. 
- To select the outcome, use the scrollable menu on the right side. Scroll to the desired number and click.
- After placing your bets, you can click SPIN to continue.

### Any Known Issues or Future Improvements:
- Logic is working fine but needs general improvement on feel
- Needs a complete UI makeover
- Lacking animations and effects to improve immersion
- 3D environment around table

### A Link or Embedded Video
- I will upload a gameplay video to Youtube, showing the prototype in action, as soon as I can.

### Design Patterns
- Observer Pattern: Implemented EventBus to decrease coupling
